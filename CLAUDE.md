# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ETHA landing page — a single-page site for an Ayurvedic wellness brand ("the Apple of Ayurveda"). The page educates users about Ayurveda, the five elements, and three Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha), then funnels them to a Dosha quiz. Built to Awwwards-level design quality with scroll animations.

**Funnel context:** The landing page + quiz is step 01–03 of an 8-step customer journey (Social → Quiz → Dosha Card → Emails → Ritual Landing → Purchase). See `docs/JOURNEY.md` for the full flow and Think/Feel/Do map per touchpoint.

## Commands

All commands run from `app/`:

```bash
cd app
npm run dev      # Next.js 16 dev server (Turbopack default)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config, Next.js core-web-vitals + TS)
```

No test framework is configured.

## Next.js 16 Breaking Changes

Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code. Key changes from training data:

- `params` and `searchParams` are **Promises** — must be awaited
- Image `priority` prop is **deprecated** — use `preload={true}`
- `cookies()`, `headers()`, `draftMode()` are **async**
- Turbopack is the **default** bundler
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@theme inline {}` in CSS, not `tailwind.config.js`

## Current State

**Animations are live.** Lenis smooth scroll + GSAP ScrollTrigger power all scroll animations. The Hero uses a pinned aura-to-fullscreen mask expansion. AuraThread draws a continuous SVG line across the full page. FiveElements blobs morph from seed. See `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` for known issues and optimization plan.

**Real images for Hero + Five Elements.** WebP images at 1200px wide in `app/public/images/`. Dosha section and Rituals section still use gradient placeholders.

**All sections are implemented** as components: Nav, Hero, ThreePillars, FiveElements, Doshas, Rituals, Academy, Community, Closure, Footer, MobileCTA.

## Architecture

### Fonts

Defined in `app/src/app/fonts.ts` using `next/font/local`. Exposed as CSS variables `--font-plantin` and `--font-brandon`, mapped to Tailwind tokens in globals.css:
- `font-serif` → Plantin (all headlines, body, emotional content)
- `font-sans` → Brandon Grotesque (**UPPERCASE ONLY** — use `.font-label` utility class which adds `uppercase` + `letter-spacing: 0.2em`)

### Tailwind v4 Tokens

All brand tokens defined in `globals.css` via `@theme inline {}`:
- Colors: `cream`, `aubergine`, `aubergine-light`, `aubergine-faint`, `aubergine-border`
- Dosha families: `vata-light`/`dark`/`accent`, `pitta-*`, `kapha-*`
- Shadows: `shadow-subtle`, `shadow-standard`, `shadow-elevated`

### Path Alias

`@/*` resolves to `./src/*` (tsconfig paths).

### GitHub Pages Deployment

Static export to GitHub Pages at `/etha-landing/`. All image `src` attributes must use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` prefix (set via `next.config.ts` + `GITHUB_PAGES` env var in CI). The deploy workflow is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### Shared Components

- **AuraButton** (`AuraButton.tsx`): Primary CTA with organic Balanced Aura SVG border. Mouse-directional morph using GSAP — the stroke deforms toward cursor position using a raised-cosine falloff. 22 control points decomposed from a balanced oval.
- **MobileCTA** (`MobileCTA.tsx`): Fixed bottom bar (mobile only). Appears after 400px scroll. Auto-flips colors (aubergine ↔ cream) when overlapping `bg-aubergine` sections via ScrollTrigger.
- **AuraThread** (`AuraThread.tsx`): Full-page continuous aura line. Fixed SVG that pans its viewBox with scroll. Stroke draws via GSAP scrub. See `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` for optimization notes.
- **SmoothScroll** (`SmoothScroll.tsx`): Lenis smooth scroll init + GSAP ticker integration.

### Section Pattern

Every section component follows the same structure:
1. `"use client"` directive (GSAP requires client-side)
2. GSAP + ScrollTrigger import and registration
3. `useRef` for animated elements
4. `useEffect` with scroll animations (some sections still have animations commented out)
5. JSX with: background aura SVG → content → optional CTA (hidden on mobile, MobileCTA handles it)

### The Aura System

The Aura is the brand's core visual element — organic SVG line art representing energy states. Three states:
- **Balanced**: simple organic oval (4-8 cubic beziers). Used in Hero, ThreePillars, Closure
- **Relaxed**: flowing blob with internal loops. Used in Rituals, Community
- **Energised**: angular with self-crossings. Used in FiveElements, Vata dosha

Rules: always `fill: none`, stroke-only, continuous path, cubic bezier curves only (no `<circle>`/`<rect>`/`<line>`), `stroke-linecap: round`, `overflow: visible`. See `.claude/rules/aura-svg.md` for full generation reference.

## Design Constraints

**Mandatory:**
- Border-radius is **0px everywhere** — organic shapes come from Aura SVGs, not UI rounding
- Shadows are **aubergine-tinted** (`rgba(61,35,59,...)`) — never neutral grey
- Text is always Aubergine on cream, Cream on aubergine — never `#000000`
- Brandon Grotesque is **UPPERCASE ONLY** with wide tracking
- Dosha colors never cross families (no Vata blue on Pitta sections)
- Antidote colors (Citrine, Aquamarine, Carnelian) are **decorative only** — never used for text

**Landing brief conflicts to be aware of:**
- `docs/landing-brief.md` specifies a single CTA ("Begin your remembering") and wants Rituals/Academy stats removed. The current implementation has multiple CTAs and all sections present. These represent two different creative directions that haven't been reconciled.
